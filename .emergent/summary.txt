<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to build the frontend for a SaaS application called WooASM.ai. This project is a React-based, frontend-only application that will be deployed to . It will communicate with a separate, pre-existing NestJS backend API hosted at .

The frontend should include:
1.  A comprehensive marketing website.
2.  User authentication pages (Login, Signup, Forgot Password).
3.  A user dashboard for managing licenses, billing, sites, and settings.
4.  An admin dashboard for analytics.
5.  All API calls must align perfectly with the backend's API specification, which has been provided.
6.  The free plan feature should be removed, and all signups should direct users to a real payment flow using Stripe test keys.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
-   **Frontend:** A multi-page marketing site, user authentication flows, a user dashboard (Dashboard, License, Billing, Sites, Usage, Settings), an admin dashboard, and checkout pages.
-   **API Integration:** All frontend components must make API calls to the  base URL. Payloads must strictly adhere to the  format and structure defined in the backend's API documentation.
-   **Authentication:** Implement JWT-based authentication, including token storage, refresh token logic, and authenticated requests using a central API service.
-   **Billing:** Integrate with Stripe for monthly/yearly subscriptions by calling the backend's checkout endpoint. The test plan feature must be removed.
-   **Documentation:** The project includes instruction manuals for the frontend, backend, and plugin developers to ensure alignment across all three teams.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The project is a **frontend-only** React application. The previously existing backend code (first Python/FastAPI, then Node.js/Express) has been completely removed as per the user's request to align with a three-part architecture (Frontend, Backend API, Plugin).

The agent has created detailed documentation and instructions for all three development teams (). It has also updated the frontend's  file to point to the production API URL ().

The agent was in the middle of a major refactoring effort to align all frontend API calls with the official NestJS backend documentation provided by the user. The primary issue being resolved is the mismatch in data formats (e.g.,  in the frontend vs.  expected by the backend) and incorrect payload structures. Several key files like the API service, AuthContext, Signup page, and some dashboard pages have already been updated.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working:** Updating the dashboard pages to align with the backend API specification. The agent had just finished updating  and was about to proceed with the other dashboard pages.
-   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
-   **Agent Testing Done:** N (Testing cannot be done until the entire refactor is complete).
-   **Which testing method agent to use?** Frontend testing agent. Once the refactor is complete, a full end-to-end test of the user flows (signup, login, dashboard, billing) is required.
-   **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1: Frontend and Backend API Misalignment (P0)**
    -   **Description:** Many frontend components still send requests with incorrect field names (e.g.,  instead of ) or incorrect data structures, causing  errors from the backend.
    -   **Attempted fixes:** The agent has successfully fixed this in , , , , , and .
    -   **Next debug checklist:** Systematically review and update every remaining component that makes an API call to ensure its request payloads and response handling match the spec in  (or the more recent version provided by the user).
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** The application is fundamentally broken without this fix. Completing this will make the entire frontend functional and connect it properly to the backend.
    -   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    -   **Is recurring issue?** Y (Across multiple files)
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend
    -   **Blocked on other issue:** None

**In progress Task List**:
-   **Task 1: Complete Frontend API Alignment Refactor (P0)**
    -   **Description:** Continue the process of updating all frontend components to match the NestJS API specification.
    -   **Where to resume:** The agent has updated . The next files to update are the remaining dashboard pages:
        -   
        -   
        -   
        -   
        -   All pages under 
    -   **What will be achieved with this?** A fully functional frontend that can communicate with the backend without errors.
    -   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend
    -   **Blocked on something:** None

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   **Upcoming Tasks:**
    -   **Task 1: Comprehensive End-to-End Testing (P0):** After the API alignment refactor is complete, use the  to test all critical user flows:
        -   User Registration -> Login -> Redirect to Dashboard.
        -   Viewing all dashboard pages (Overview, License, Sites, Usage, Billing, Settings).
        -   Initiating a Stripe checkout session.
        -   Admin Login -> Viewing admin pages.
    -   **Task 2: Implement Token Refresh Logic (P1):** The backend API documentation provides a guide for handling expired access tokens using a refresh token. This logic needs to be implemented in the frontend's API service () to ensure seamless user sessions.

**Completed work in this session**
-   **Major Architectural Pivot:** The project was transformed from a full-stack MERN application into a frontend-only React application.
-   **Project Cleanup:** The entire  directory, created during a temporary migration to Node.js/Express, was deleted to reflect the new architecture.
-   **Documentation Creation:** Comprehensive instruction documents for the backend, frontend, and plugin developers were created and stored in the  directory.
-   **API Endpoint Configuration:** The frontend's environment variable  was correctly set to .
-   **API Alignment Refactor (Partial):** Began the critical task of aligning the frontend with the backend API spec. The following files have been updated:
    -   
    -   
    -   
    -   
    -   
    -   
-   **Feature Removal:** The test plan / free signup feature was removed from the  as requested.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend:** React, React Router, TailwindCSS,  (in )
-   **Architecture:** Decoupled frontend (React) and backend (NestJS). Communication via REST API.
-   **Authentication:** JWT (Access & Refresh Tokens). The frontend is responsible for storing tokens and handling refresh logic.

**key DB schema**
-   Not applicable for this project, as it is frontend-only. All data models are defined and managed by the separate NestJS backend.

**changes in tech stack**
-   The project was converted from a full-stack (React + FastAPI, then React + Express) application to a **frontend-only** React application.

**All files of reference**
-   **Ground Truth for API:** The user-provided NestJS API documentation (summarized in chat history, and a version was saved to ). This is the most critical document.
-   **Central API Logic:**  (handles all requests).
-   **State Management:**  (handles user state and auth).
-   **Pages to Fix:** All files in  and  that have not yet been updated.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   The main refactoring task (API alignment) is currently in progress.

**key api endpoints**
-   Base URL: 
-   
-   
-   
-   
-   

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **This is a frontend-only project.** Do not create or modify any backend code. All data and business logic are handled by the external API at .
-   **The API specification is the law.** Your primary task is to ensure every API call in the React code matches the documentation provided by the user. The main issue is the  payload requirement.
-   **Resume the refactoring.** Your immediate task is to continue updating the remaining dashboard and admin pages, starting with .
-   After the refactor, a full end-to-end test using the frontend testing agent is mandatory before finishing.

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending HUMAN messages**
1.  **User (latest):** Provided the complete, detailed README for the NestJS backend API, which serves as the definitive source of truth for all frontend API calls. Reported  errors on the live signup page due to payload mismatches.
2.  **Agent:** Acknowledged the need for the API spec to fix the errors.
3.  **User:** Asked if all frontend calls are now directed to .
4.  **Agent:** Confirmed they are but noticed the  file still had a preview URL and corrected it to .
5.  **User:** Noticed leftover backend files in the GitHub repo.
6.  **Agent:** Explained that the files were deleted locally and the user needs to Save to GitHub to push the deletions.
7.  **User:** Asked why there is a  folder in a project that should be frontend-only.
8.  **Agent:** Apologized, agreed it was a mistake, and deleted the entire  directory.
9.  **User:** Provided comprehensive instructions to create documentation for all three teams (frontend, backend, plugin) to ensure alignment.
10. **User:** Made a critical architectural clarification: this project is just the frontend, the API is a separate NestJS project, and there's a third WordPress plugin project.

**Project Health Check:**
-   **Broken:** The application is non-functional because most pages send incorrect requests to the backend. The ongoing refactor is intended to fix this.
-   **Mocked:** No data is mocked; the application is intended to work with the live backend API.

**3rd Party Integrations**
-   **Stripe (Payments):** Integrated via the backend. The frontend's only role is to call the  endpoint and redirect the user to the returned Stripe URL.
-   **React/Axios:** Used for making HTTP requests to the backend.

**Testing status**
-   **Testing agent used after significant changes:** NO (Not since the major API alignment refactor began).
-   **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop:** NO
-   **Test files created:** None
-   **Known regressions:** The entire application is in a regressed state due to the API mismatch.

**Credentials to test flow:**
-   **User:**  / 
-   **Admin:**  / 
-   (These are from the backend documentation and should be used for testing the frontend flows).

**What agent forgot to execute**
The agent has not forgotten anything but is in the middle of a large, multi-file refactoring task. It must continue this task systematically before it can proceed to testing and completion. The immediate next step is to fix the remaining dashboard pages.</analysis>
