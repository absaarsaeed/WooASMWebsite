    question: 'Do I need technical skills to use WooASM?',
    answer: 'Not at all! If you can send a text message, you can use WooASM. Just type your questions in plain English and the AI handles the rest.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Is my store data secure?',
    answer: 'Absolutely. WooASM runs entirely within your WordPress installation. Your data never leaves your server except for API calls to OpenAI, which are encrypted and not stored.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the cost of using OpenAI API?',
    answer: 'Most stores spend $5-20/month on API costs depending on usage. The time savings far outweigh this minimal expense.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I try before I buy?',
    answer: 'Yes! We offer a free tier with basic features so you can experience WooASM before upgrading. No credit card required.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Does it work with my theme/plugins?',
    answer: 'WooASM works with any WordPress theme and is compatible with all major WooCommerce extensions. It uses WordPress native REST API.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What if the AI makes a mistake?',
    answer: 'Every risky action requires your confirmation first. Plus, all actions are logged and can be restored with one click. You are always in control.'
